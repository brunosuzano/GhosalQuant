'''
The estimation of the uncertainty is taken in relation to a stock's price characteristics:
The estimation shall be realised using the probability of the exercise in the Black Merton Scholes'
option pricing model.

In this case, the strike price is replaced with an analysts' target price, which should 
indicate the probability of the price being reached, under current market assumptions.

See Chapter 15 from Hull's Options, Futures, and other derivatives for more details on how the 
probability is calculated.

The confidence in this case is treated similarly to the pricing of a digital option with a notional of 1
To simplify things, it estimates the probability that the target price is touched.

The model can be found in the fusion invest financial models reference manual at page 887.
